<h1>Welcome to the portfolio of Lasse Krøigaard</h1>
<p>I am 25 years old, have a bachelor's degree from Aalborg University in Medialogy, and this is a website where you can have a look at many of my projects in my career</p>
<img src="Images/Portfolio/Profile picture1.png"  alt="">
<p>Here are a few links that can take you to different projects I have worked on in my time at Uni</p>
<p>It includes a short description and a few pictures. A few updates to the website still coming</p>
<p>Until then, I hope you enjoy my progress on it, as this is my first HTML project and it will be update in real time</p>
