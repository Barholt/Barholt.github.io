<h1>Welcome to the portfolio of Lasse Krøigaard</h1>
<p>I am 25 years old, have a bachelor's degree from Aalborg University in Medialogy, and this is a website where you can have a look at many of my projects in my career</p>

<p>I am currently still working on this website, but plan to have my projects up inside of the week</p>
<p>Until then, I hope you enjoy my progress on it, as this is my first HTML project and it will be update in real time</p>

    <h2>Stress app</h2>
    <h3>An app for stress and recreational self-tracking</h3>
    <article>
        <p>One of my first projects on the university was one, where our team thought up an app concept,
             that was meant to encourage the user to take plenty of time to recreate themselves, in order to try and combat a stressful workday.
            The app has been made, so that every time the user does a new activity they can log it with how long they spent and what it was.
        At the end of the day, they can then analyze the graph to see what activities they have done. They can also log how many times they have 
    been stressed and the point of the app is to see, if the user can reduce their stress by being encouraged to do enough recreational activities.
    It was made for Android and programmed in Java.

    <h2>Thermal camera exercise</h2>
    <h3>A program that utilizes a thermal camera to track the user doing specific exercises</h3>
    <p>This was a project made in order to incorporate image processing into an application.
        We used a thermal camera in order to be able to identify the user more easily, instead of creating some tech like a Kinect.
        The camera tracks the hands and head of the user. The user can see their thermal outline on the screen and it has to match up with a static outline on the screen.
        Some pictures of these different outlines and how the camera tracks them is here. It was programmed with C++.

    <h2>Music board</h2>
    <h3>An arduino board made for children to teach them notes</h3>
<p>This was a project made to incorporate audio and an arduino into it. We made a board with the purpose of teaching
    children different music notes. First the computer will give the child the task of pressing the right note on the board.
    The musical note will play, and the computer will say if it was either right or wrong. This project had a lot of focus on 
    circuiting the wires and optimising the code efficiently.

    <h2>Kanda Simulation</h2>
    <h3>A VR simulation where the user learns how to build a satellite receiver dish</h3>
    <p>
        This is a collaborative project made with a VR-company, Kanda, that is based in Aarhus. They have credit for all the art assets, and the dish that is built.
        My team however worked on building the orange avatar that demonstrates how to build the satellite receiver as well as the blue outline, that shows the user which of the 
        objects to use in order to keep building. This project was a great exercise for me on how to integrate my own systems into other people's work. It was made in Unity.

    <h2>Minotaur game</h2>
    <h3>A VR horror game with a Minotaur hunting the player</h3>
    <p>
        This was a Unity VR game built from the ground up. The gameplay takes inspiration from Slender and has the player gathering three keys in a small maze, while running away 
        from a Minotaur that hunts them. This was a good experience with shader programming for the water in the fountain, pathfinding, general game design and learning the basics
        of a VR game.

    <h2>Educational game</h2>
    <h3>A game made to educate children about geometry</h3>
    <p>
        This was an educational game made to educate children about geometry. It had a focus on understanding concepts and properties of figures, rather than focusing
        on things such as how to measure lines or calculate volumes. The target demographic was children from 6-9 years old. It features 3 different exercises connected
        together with a small 3d overworld. We used the overworld to introduce the children to terms in the exercise. They move around the overworld with standard first 
        person controls and each of the exercises have different kinds of controls, ranging from mouse, arrow keys and a combination. It was programmed in Unity.
