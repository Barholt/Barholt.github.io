        <h2>Kanda Simulation</h2>
        <h3>A VR simulation where the user learns how to build a satellite receiver dish</h3>
        <p>
            This is a collaborative project made with a VR-company, Kanda, that is based in Aarhus. They have credit for all the art assets, and the dish that is built.
            My team however worked on building the orange avatar that demonstrates how to build the satellite receiver as well as the blue outline, that shows the user which of the 
            objects to use in order to keep building. This project was a great exercise for me on how to integrate my own systems into other people's work. It was made in Unity.
