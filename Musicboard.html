        <h2>Music board</h2>
        <h3>An arduino board made for children to teach them notes</h3>
    <p>This was a project made to incorporate audio and an arduino into it. We made a board with the purpose of teaching
        children different music notes. First the computer will give the child the task of pressing the right note on the board.
        The musical note will play, and the computer will say if it was either right or wrong. This project had a lot of focus on 
        circuiting the wires and optimising the code efficiently.
