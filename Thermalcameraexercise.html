        <h2>Thermal camera exercise</h2>
        <h3>A program that utilizes a thermal camera to track the user doing specific exercises</h3>
        <p>This was a project made in order to incorporate image processing into an application.
            We used a thermal camera in order to be able to identify the user more easily, instead of creating some tech like a Kinect.
            The camera tracks the hands and head of the user. The user can see their thermal outline on the screen and it has to match up with a static outline on the screen.
            Some pictures of these different outlines and how the camera tracks them is here. It was programmed with C++.
