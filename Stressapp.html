    <h2>Stress app</h2>
    <h3>An app for stress and recreational self-tracking</h3>
    <article>
        <p>One of my first projects on the university was one, where our team thought up an app concept,
             that was meant to encourage the user to take plenty of time to recreate themselves, in order to try and combat a stressful workday.
            The app has been made, so that every time the user does a new activity they can log it with how long they spent and what it was.
        At the end of the day, they can then analyze the graph to see what activities they have done. They can also log how many times they have 
    been stressed and the point of the app is to see, if the user can reduce their stress by being encouraged to do enough recreational activities.
    It was made for Android and programmed in Java.
